        being identical to each other.
        Each side of each track is stored as its own track, in order (so, track 0 side 0, track 0 side 1,
        track 1 side 0, track 1 side 0, etc.).
        The table of the offsets of tracks is 2048 bytes long, each track offset is an unigned 32-bit
        integer. An offset of 00000000 indicates the track is not present in the file.
        As an example, an 86F representing a disk with 80 thin tracks and 2 sides per track, where all
        the tracks are present in the file, would have the first 160 offsets filled in, same for a disk
        with 40 thick tracks and 2 sides. Same with only 1 side but only the offsets at 0000000, 0000008,
        etc. (so every second offset) would be filled in.
